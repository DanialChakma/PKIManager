CertHub is a centralized platform for automated certificate lifecycle management, offering seamless integration for generating, renewing, revoking, and distributing certificates across your organization. It simplifies the process of maintaining a trusted PKI infrastructure with high scalability and security.

The system operates based on a multi-tier CA hierarchy, where:
1.	Root CA (Root Certificate Authority):
The highest authority in the certificate chain, responsible for signing intermediate CAs and providing the trust anchor for the entire PKI ecosystem. The Root CA should remain offline as much as possible to protect it from exposure.
2.	Intermediate CA (Intermediate Certificate Authority):
Serves as an intermediary between the Root CA and Leaf CA (end-entity certificates). It signs certificates for Leaf CAs or directly issues certificates for servers, services, or users. Intermediate CAs help mitigate the risk of compromising the Root CA.
3.	Leaf CA (Leaf Certificate Authority):
The certificate issued to individual devices, servers, or services. It is typically signed by an Intermediate CA. These are the certificates used in day-to-day operations, ensuring end-to-end encryption, identity verification, and trust.

CertHub is a centralized platform for automated certificate lifecycle management, offering seamless integration for generating, renewing, revoking, and distributing certificates across your organization. It simplifies the process of maintaining a trusted PKI infrastructure with high scalability and security.

The system operates based on a multi-tier CA hierarchy, where:
1.	Root CA (Root Certificate Authority):
The highest authority in the certificate chain, responsible for signing intermediate CAs and providing the trust anchor for the entire PKI ecosystem. The Root CA should remain offline as much as possible to protect it from exposure.
2.	Intermediate CA (Intermediate Certificate Authority):
Serves as an intermediary between the Root CA and Leaf CA (end-entity certificates). It signs certificates for Leaf CAs or directly issues certificates for servers, services, or users. Intermediate CAs help mitigate the risk of compromising the Root CA.
3.	Leaf CA (Leaf Certificate Authority):
The certificate issued to individual devices, servers, or services. It is typically signed by an Intermediate CA. These are the certificates used in day-to-day operations, ensuring end-to-end encryption, identity verification, and trust.


Detailed Architecture:
1.	Root CA:
o	Private Key Management: The Root CA private key is never exposed online to minimize the risk of compromise. It is used only to sign Intermediate CAs and occasionally for rekeying purposes.
o	Rotation of Root CA: The Root CA certificate needs to be rotated (replaced with a new key) periodically (typically every 10–20 years). When the Root CA is rotated, all Intermediate CAs must also be re-signed by the new Root CA. This ensures the trust anchor is updated.
o	Root CA Certificate Revocation: In case of a breach or if a new Root CA needs to be generated, the old Root CA certificate should be revoked, and the new certificate should be trusted across the system.
2.	Intermediate CA:
o	Intermediate CA Rotation: The Intermediate CA should also be rotated periodically (typically every 5–10 years). When the Root CA rotates, new Intermediate CAs are generated and signed by the new Root.
o	Intermediate CA Signatures: The Intermediate CA signs Leaf CA certificates. If the Intermediate CA is rotated, it will need to re-sign the Leaf CAs certificates issued under the old Intermediate.
o	Intermediate CA Revocation: If an Intermediate CA is compromised or its lifecycle is complete, it must be revoked, and all Leaf CA certificates signed by that Intermediate must also be revoked or reissued.
3.	Leaf CA:
o	Leaf Certificates: These certificates are used for securing communication between servers and clients (e.g., HTTPS, email encryption). They can be issued by the Intermediate CA.
o	Rekeying and Renewal: Whenever the Root CA or Intermediate CA is rotated, the Leaf CA certificates need to be renewed or reissued to ensure they remain valid under the new trust chain.
o	Automatic Renewal: Leaf CA certificates can be automatically renewed as they approach expiration, ensuring minimal downtime or disruption.
o	Revocation: If a Leaf certificate is no longer valid (e.g., the associated private key is compromised), it should be automatically revoked, and a replacement issued.
